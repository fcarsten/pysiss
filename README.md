This is a python module to carry out some basic analysis of borehole data

Building and installing `pyboreholes`
------------------------------------------

All you should need to do is enter the python directory, and execute

    $ python setup.py build && python setup.py install

which should build and install the Python bindings for your system.

Building documentation
----------------------

There's no documentation yet - you need to put a rocket up Jess' arse to get this done soon!
