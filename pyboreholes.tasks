Other tasks:

  - Redo interpolation in regularize so that knots are only calculated once, use splpack wrappers in scipy.interpolate
  - Work out 2D interpolation for wavelet domains 
    - use bisplev again in scipy.interpolate to only calculate knots once, evaluate over grid.
    - Is it better to calculate this using a matrix-vector multiply? Can use lookups because we'll always have a regular grid to do things off. Moving to irregular grids with wavelets might make things difficult though...
