.. _intro:

Welcome to python_boreholes!
****************************

This is a python module to do a bunch of data stuff with borehole data. Things are pretty bare-bones at the moment - hopefully this will change as we decide how we want to use this library.

Probably the easiest way to get a feel for the behavior of the library is to have a look at the use cases supplied in this documentation.
